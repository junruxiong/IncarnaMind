## If this changes UI

Delete this section if the change has no UI. Otherwise check each line against [the interaction rules](https://github.com/junruxiong/IncarnaMind/blob/main/docs/agents/interaction.md):

- [ ] Each gesture follows a named app's convention (Claude, ChatGPT, Finder, Notion, Granola, or a Chinese app), or this says why none fits
- [ ] Names shown rename in place (double-click, Enter or F2; Enter saves, Esc cancels; safe with a Chinese input method)
- [ ] Every drag has a menu and a keyboard way to do the same thing; targets highlight only while they accept
- [ ] Nothing replaces the Mind the User is in; no "Back to…" label
- [ ] Reversible actions offer Undo (⌘Z and the undo line) instead of a confirmation; deleting goes to Recently deleted
- [ ] Objects have the shared right-click and ⋯ menu, in the shared order
- [ ] Selection works as everywhere: click opens, ⌘/Ctrl-click and Shift-click select, ⌘A, Esc
- [ ] Every action works by keyboard and is in ⌘K; focus is visible; Esc closes the innermost thing
- [ ] Responds within 100 ms; anything over a second shows progress where it happens
- [ ] One primary action and one visible way to do it; no new setting without a reason given here
- [ ] Problems show in place as one line with one action; words from `CONTEXT.md`, in English and Chinese
- [ ] Layout holds at a narrow and a wide window, with and without the viewer; text never breaks by letter
- [ ] Uses the shared building blocks where they exist, and no one-off where they don't
- [ ] Tested like a person in the built app, with the mouse and the keyboard
- [ ] Before and after screenshots attached (narrow and wide)
- [ ] A screenshot of the built screen beside its design board, with every difference listed and explained
