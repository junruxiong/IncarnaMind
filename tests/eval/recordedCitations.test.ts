/**
 * The Citations an evaluation run recorded, checked again with today's
 * Citation check, without asking a model again.
 *
 * The run of 2026-10-07 (Ollama's mistral, eval/README.md) marked 3 of its 12
 * English Citations "not found" though their quotes are on the cited pages: a
 * capital letter at the start of a quote, a reference "[36]" written "[^36]",
 * and an ellipsis. Its Citations are copied in
 * tests/fixtures/eval-citations-2026-10-07.json. Each is checked against the
 * cited pages' stored text, which the processing pipeline (`processFile`, as
 * the core runs it before writing `document_pages`) gives for the sample PDFs
 * in data/ and the Chinese fixtures in eval/retrieval/fixtures/, and its
 * outcome is classified as the evaluation classifies it.
