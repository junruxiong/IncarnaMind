/**
 * The Citation check, case by case, in English and Chinese (#31): the text
 * PDFs give and the quotes models write differ in hyphenation, ligatures,
 * full-width punctuation and CJK spacing, quotes run across page breaks, and
 * models cite page ranges that break the page-range rule. eval/README.md
 * lists these cases with the end-to-end tests that cover them too.
 *
 * Each case is a Document's stored page text (as processing stores it, see
 * `pageTexts`), a Citation's pages and the pages of its Passage, and the quote.
 *
 * The letter case, reference mark and ellipsis cases come from the evaluation
 * run of 2026-10-07 with Ollama's mistral, where the check said "not found"
 * for three quotes that are on their pages: the page text is the stored text
 * of the sample PDFs in data/, cut short.
