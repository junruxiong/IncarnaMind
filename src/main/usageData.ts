/**
 * Usage data (#187) with PostHog's Node SDK (`posthog-node`), only while the
 * User agrees. The core decides when (src/core/usageData.ts) and checks every
 * event against src/core/usageEvents.ts; this module only sends them.
 *
 * Only a build made with a PostHog project sends anything: the project key
 * and host come from build-time configuration (`MAIN_VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`,
 * `MAIN_VITE_POSTHOG_HOST`, read by electron-vite), never from the code.
 * Without them the SDK isn't loaded and nothing reaches the network.
 *
 * The SDK runs in the main process, so the renderer never talks to the
 * network: the interface's events reach the core over IPC. posthog-node has
 * no autocapture, session replay or surveys (they are browser features of
 * posthog-js, which isn't used), and here it is set up to do nothing but send
 * the events it is given:
 * - no feature flags or remote config: no secret key, nothing preloaded, no
 *   flag events, and no exception autocapture;
 * - no person profiles (`$process_person_profile: false`), and the random
 *   install ID as `distinct_id`: nothing identifies the User;
 * - no location (`disableGeoip`), and `$ip` set to "0.0.0.0", which PostHog
 *   stores in place of the connection's address (it fills in a missing or
 *   null `$ip` from the request);
 * - the only requests are batches of events to the build's host: anything
 *   else the SDK might try is refused here, unsent.
 *
 * Events wait in a short queue in memory, at most `MAX_QUEUED_EVENTS`, and go
 * together every so often. A send that fails (offline, timed out, refused) is
 * dropped without a retry or an error: usage data never gets in the way.
 * Turning usage data off stops sending at once and drops the queue, along
 * with the SDK's client; turning it on again starts a new one.
 *
 * `posthog-node` is a devDependency on purpose: electron-vite bundles what is
 * used here into a chunk loaded only once usage data is on, as for Sentry
 * (./crashReports).
