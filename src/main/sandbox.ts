/**
 * The OS sandbox for the programs Tools run, Skill scripts first (#65;
 * ADR-0013; docs/research/sandboxing.md): the "os" Executor, on macOS
 * (Seatbelt) and Linux (bubblewrap), through `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime`,
 * pinned to an exact version in package.json. It is how Claude Code, Codex,
 * Cursor and Zed confine the commands their agents run.
 *
 * A program, and every process it starts:
 * - can't read the folders in `denyRead` (the User's home and IncarnaMind's
 *   data folder), except the folders its request allows (a Skill script's
 *   Skill folder and working folder) and its interpreter's own install when
 *   that is inside one (pyenv, conda, the app itself in ~/Applications). The
 *   rest of the disk stays readable, as sandbox-runtime leaves it: the
 *   system's libraries and interpreters;
 * - can write only the folders its request allows (its working folder),
 *   which is its TMPDIR too. sandbox-runtime hands out /tmp/claude, Claude
 *   Code's, which is denied here;
 * - has no network, not even to this computer.
 *
 * sandbox-runtime's `initialize()` isn't called: it starts a proxy that lets
 * allowlisted hosts through (and socat bridges on Linux) and listens for
 * SIGINT and SIGTERM, which would keep the app from quitting on them. With no
 * proxy, a wrap whose allowlist is empty blocks the network outright: no
 * localhost exception in the Seatbelt profile, and `--unshare-net` with no
 * bridge on Linux. What `initialize()` checks first, `loadOsSandbox` checks,
 * and then runs `true` in the sandbox to be sure.
 *
 * The Executor leaves out variables whose names look like secrets
 * (../core/execution), at every level. No Electron imports: tests run this
 * in Node.
