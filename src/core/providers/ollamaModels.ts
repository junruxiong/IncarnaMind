 * - How it cites, chosen from those before the first request (see
 *   `citingMode`): "tools" with the `tools` capability, else structured output.
 *   Ollama holds any completion model to a JSON schema with `format`.
 * - Its context window, `num_ctx` (see `chooseNumCtx`), and the output cap.
 * - `think`: off, so a model answers at once, unless it can only think.
 *
 * Looked up with plain `fetch`: `/api/tags` for the model's digest and size,
 * then `/api/show`. Kept per server, model and digest, so a model pulled again
 * is looked up again, and every request to a model carries the same `num_ctx`:
 * Ollama reloads a model whose `num_ctx` changes.
