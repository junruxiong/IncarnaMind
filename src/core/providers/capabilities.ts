/**
 * What a model can do, as known before IncarnaMind sends it anything. Facts
 * come from several places; when they disagree, the first that says wins:
 *
 * 1. What the User set on the model.
 * 2. What the server reports: Ollama's model details (`/api/show`, see
 *    ./ollamaModels), or a provider's model list where it gives
 *    capabilities (Anthropic's `/v1/models`, see ./modelLists).
 * 3. The catalog's entry for the model (see ./catalog).
 * 4. Unknown. The model still works, marked "capabilities unknown", and an
 *    Answer finds out as it goes, as before the catalog: it starts with
 *    Tools and steps down when they or structured output are refused, sends
 *    a temperature and drops it when refused, sends no images, and isn't
 *    sized to a window.
 *
 * Refusals are server reports too: what an Answer learns of a model (its
 * provider refused Tools, structured output or a temperature) holds over
 * what is known here for the rest of the session (see ../answers).
