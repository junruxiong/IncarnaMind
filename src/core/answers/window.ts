/**
 * Keeping an Answer's requests within a local model's context window (see
 * `ContextWindow`). Ollama is told the window (`num_ctx`) and to refuse a
 * longer request rather than cut it (see ../providers/ollamaChat), so nothing
 * is lost without notice: the engine makes each request fit, by IncarnaMind's
 * own rules, giving up first what matters least:
 *
 * 1. The Question context loses its oldest content first, as
 *    `buildQuestionContext` does (see `fitQuestionContext`), down to the
 *    Question alone. In the Tool loop, room for one search is kept first.
 * 2. Search results keep the most relevant Passages that fit what is left,
 *    by the search's own ranks (see `SearchResultForModel.ranks`), in the
 *    order the search gave them, and other Tool results are cut at the end.
 *    Once nothing more would fit, the model is told to answer with what it has.
 * 3. Every request keeps the room the model's output cap needs.
 *
 * A request whose instructions and Question alone don't fit fails with a
 * "too-long" error before anything is sent.
 *
 * Token counts are estimated (see `estimateTokens`) times a factor, until
 * Ollama's own count of a request comes back (`prompt_eval_count`, its input
 * tokens): from then on the Tool loop counts from it, and the factor is
 * corrected for the rest of the Answer and the model's next ones. A model's
 * tokenizer can count far more than the estimate: 1.35 times for Chinese with
 * Mistral's (docs/research/ollama-integration.md), almost 2 for text full of
 * digits with Qwen's, which splits numbers into single digits.
