/**
 * Structured output's one second chance at quotes (ADR-0007). In the Tool
 * loop, `cite` tells the model which quotes aren't word for word on the pages
 * they cite, and it may fix them. Structured output's one request gets no
 * such word, and small local models reword or stitch quotes (#67). So once a
 * local model's Answer is written and its records placed, the quotes the
 * check doesn't find are asked for once more, in one short request for all of
 * them: each record's marker, the Answer's sentence it is on, its quote, and
 * its Passage's text (the part nearest the quote when the Passage is long),
 * with a request to copy an exact quote from that text, or none.
 *
 * A new quote replaces a record's only when the check finds it on the pages
 * it then cites (see `AnswerTools.correctQuote`); otherwise the record stays
 * as it was, "not found". So the request can't make a Citation worse.
 *
 * - **When:** only in structured output, only for a local model (the engine
 *   passes a window budget), at most once per Answer, and only when some
 *   quote isn't found: an Answer whose quotes are all found makes no request.
 * - **Cost:** one request, of at most `MAX_RETRIED_RECORDS` records, each
 *   with at most `EXCERPT_TOKENS` of its Passage, and an output cap of
 *   `OUTPUT_TOKENS_PER_RECORD` a record. The Answer's phase shows it
 *   ("checking-quotes"), and its end reports it (`AnswerFinished.quoteRetry`),
 *   so the evaluation counts the requests, what they recovered and their time.
