/**
 * Embeds Documents' Passages with the current embedding model, one Document
 * after another: the built-in model one Passage at a time (ADR-0009: batches
 * were no faster, and changed int8 results), an API provider in batches. A
 * Document's status goes from "embedding" to "ready"; while the model can't
 * be used it waits as "waiting-for-model". Only the Document whose turn it is
 * is shown as embedding; the others stored as "embedding" wait their turn,
 * shown as queued (`isEmbedding`). Each batch of vectors is stored as it
 * comes, so a quit loses at most one batch's work.
 *
 * The model each Document's vectors come from is recorded with them
 * (documents.embedding_model, and their size in documents.embedding_dimensions).
 * When the User switches model, every Document goes back to "embedding", and
 * keeps its old vectors until its turn comes: then they are dropped and the
 * new model's written. Switching back before that costs nothing for the
 * Documents not yet reached. Vectors from two models are never left in one Document.
