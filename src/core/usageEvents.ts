/**
 * Usage data (#187): every event IncarnaMind can send, and every field of
 * each, in one place. Nothing else can be sent: the core checks each event
 * against this list before it leaves (`parseUsageEvent`), and
 * docs/privacy.md lists the same.
 *
 * A field is one of three kinds, and nothing else:
 * - `oneOf`: one value of a closed list, so no text the User wrote (a
 *   Document's name, a Question, a Folder or Tag name, a path) can fit;
 * - `count`: a whole number, 0 or more, such as a count or a duration;
 * - `flag`: true or false.
 *
 * Events go out only while the User agrees (./usage), under a random install
 * ID, with `COMMON_FIELDS`. The same names will serve the mobile app.
 *
 * Pure module, with no imports but types: the renderer may import it too.
