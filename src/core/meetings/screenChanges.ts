 * When a shared window is worth reading (ADR-0024), from the small grey

 * from the last one read and has then stayed still for `STILL_MS`, because
 * screen-share video sharpens once the image settles and a blurry frame
 * misreads digits. Parts of the window that keep changing, such as a video
 * tile, a spinner or a blinking cursor, are left out of both comparisons.
 * Pure: the times are the samples'.
