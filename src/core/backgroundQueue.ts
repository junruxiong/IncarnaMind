/**
 * The background model queue (docs/designs/library-structure-view.md, R4, R8
 * and O7): background work that calls a model, automatic tagging now and
 * Topic naming later, runs here, one job at a time, in the order queued,
 * whatever its kind.
 *
 * Answers come first:
 * - While any Answer is being written, no job starts. Jobs queued meanwhile
 *   wait, and start once none is.
 * - When an Answer starts, a job whose model call is in flight on a model
 *   server on this computer (Ollama, or another local endpoint) is aborted
 *   and queued again at the front. Such a server serves one request at a
 *   time, so the Answer would otherwise wait behind it. A call to a cloud
 *   provider finishes: aborting it would waste paid tokens, for no gain.
