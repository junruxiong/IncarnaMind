/**
 * Skill scripts (#41): running one of a Skill's scripts as a child process,
 * for the `run_skill_script` Tool. Answers ask the User first (see
 * ../approvals); this module only runs what was allowed.
 *
 * - The interpreter is chosen by the file's extension: Python through
 *   `python3` (`python` on Windows) and shell scripts through `bash`, both
 *   found on the User's login-shell PATH; JavaScript through the app's own
 *   Node.js (Electron's, as plain Node), so nothing needs installing for it.
 *   Shell scripts on Windows, TypeScript and other kinds give a plain error,
 *   and so does an interpreter that isn't installed, naming what to install.
 * - The script finds its Skill's folder in the `SKILL_DIR` environment variable.
 * - The core's `Executor` (see ../execution) runs it: in a new, empty
 *   temporary working folder, removed afterwards; with no input, until it
 *   exits or its timeout; stopped with every process it started on a
 *   timeout, a Stop, or IncarnaMind closing; what it writes kept up to
 *   `SKILL_SCRIPT_LIMITS.maxOutputBytes` per stream (the start of its
 *   standard output, the end of its error output), with a note when cut.
 * - It asks the Executor to allow reading the Skill's folder and the working
 *   folder, writing the working folder, and the network (any, for now).
 *
 * At sandbox level "none" (v1) none of that is enforced: a script can do
 * whatever the User can, including reaching the network (see `access`).
 * That is why each run asks first.
