/**
 * Approvals (#38): a Tool call that could change something asks the User
 * before it runs. Whether it asks is decided from its Effects (what it can
 * do, see ./tools) and the User's policy for it (`decide`;
 * docs/designs/agent-extensibility.md §4.3).
 *
 * - Reading the Documents or a Skill runs without asking. So does a
 *   Connector's Tool its Connector marks read-only (MCP's `readOnlyHint`):
 *   it only reads from the Connector's service and sends to it, which the
 *   User's consent to that service covers. The mark is a hint IncarnaMind
 *   can't check, so the User can switch such a Tool to "ask". Every other
 *   Connector Tool asks first, unless the User always allows it.
 * - Skill scripts (#41) always ask, unless the User chose "always run" for
 *   the Skill, which they must confirm after a risk warning (`riskAccepted`):
 *   a script runs on this computer with no sandbox.
 * - Policies replace the default for one subject: a Connector's Tool, or a
 *   Skill's scripts. They are rows in SQLite, sync-ready (ADR-0003): UUIDs,
 *   timestamps, soft deletes, and no secrets.
 * - Requests: an Answer's call that asks raises "approval.requested" and waits
 *   for `respond`, racing the Answer's abort signal, so stopping the Answer
 *   while it waits withdraws the request at once ("approval.resolved", deny).
 *   Closing the core denies whatever is still waiting.
