/**
 * Finding a quote in a Document's text: the Citation check (#30) decides with
 * it whether a quote is on its cited pages, and the viewer highlights what it
 * finds, so the badge and the highlight always agree.
 *
 * The quote and the text are normalised the same way, then matched as an
 * exact substring. First the shared normaliser (`normaliseWithOffsets` in
 * ./text): NFKC, which also turns ligatures ("ﬁ") and Greek letter variants
 * ("ϵ", "𝜖") into plain letters, CJK radical look-alikes folded, invisible
 * characters such as soft hyphens dropped, quote marks and dashes unified,
 * line-break hyphenation handled, whitespace next to CJK removed and the rest
 * collapsed. Then, for matching only, so indexing and embeddings keep the
 * shared normaliser's text:
 *
 * - letters are compared in lower case, with the final sigma "ς" as "σ": a
 *   quote that starts mid-sentence is often given a capital;
 * - the quote marks and dashes the shared normaliser leaves alone ("‹", "›",
 *   "ʼ", "⸺", "⸻") are unified too;
 * - a reference or footnote mark "[^36]" reads "[36]": models write a paper's
 *   reference "[36]" in the syntax of our own Citation markers. Only matching
 *   reads it so: the markers in an Answer's text are never touched;
 * - a soft hyphen that ends a line is read as a hyphen, so the word split
 *   there is joined like any other ("inter\u00ad\nnational");
 * - a pipe that breaks a table's cells, a lone "|" with whitespace or a
 *   line's start or end beside it, reads as a space: a Markdown table's row
 *   ("| Water filter | 0.4 kg |") is found without its pipes, and a row of a
 *   slide's or a Word file's table, whose cells are stored separated by tabs,
 *   with pipes between them, as models write rows (#76). A pipe inside a word
 *   ("a|b") or doubled ("||") stays a pipe;
 * - traditional Chinese characters are read as simplified ones, character by
 *   character, by OpenCC's table (./hanVariants): a page in traditional
 *   characters is quoted in simplified ones when the Answer is written in
 *   them ("讓全球" as "让全球"), and the other way round. Phrases aren't
 *   converted, and a character stays one character, so offsets hold
 *   (ADR-0009).
 *
 * The match itself has two tolerances:
 *
 * - A hyphen that ended a line between two letters may be in the quote or
 *   not ("inter-\nnational" matches "international" and "inter-national"), or
 *   be followed by a space ("inter- national"): the normaliser can only guess
 *   whether it was a real hyphen, and a model may copy the line break as a
 *   space.
 * - An ellipsis ("..." or "…") inside a quote that isn't in the text as it is
 *   marks words left out. The quote is found when each part is in the text,
 *   in order, and every part has at least `MIN_PART_WORDS` words and
 *   `MIN_PART_CHARACTERS` letters or digits: a shorter part would be found
 *   almost anywhere, and "found" must keep meaning that these words are on the
 *   page. Each part is returned, for the viewer to highlight. An ellipsis at
 *   the start or the end of a quote leaves nothing out of it.
 *
 * - In a Document whose text lost its f-ligatures (see `lostLigatures`), a
 *   quote's "fi", "fl", "ff", "ffi" or "ffl" may be the lone "f" the text
 *   kept: pdf.js reads some PDFs' ligatures as their first letter only, so a
 *   page that shows "finance" has "fnance" for text. Not every one is lost
 *   ("Firm", with a capital, kept its "Fi"), so the quote and the text are
 *   both read with each ligature's letters as one "f". Only there: in other
 *   text, 4% of words would then match another ("of" an "off", "food" a
 *   "flood", "four" a "flour"), which is a word changed (ADR-0009).
 *
 * Nothing else is forgiven: a quote with a word changed, added or dropped
 * isn't found.
 *
 * Spreadsheets (ADR-0011) are matched with `numbers` on: number formatting is
 * normalised in the quote and the text alike, so a figure matches however it
 * is written, while its digits, decimals and sign must agree:
 *
 * - thousands separators go: "4,812", "4 812" and "4812" are the same. In the
 *   text, a separating space must be a real one: a tab, which separates
 *   cells, never joins numbers. In the quote, spaces between groups of three
 *   digits are tried as separators first, then as spaces;
 * - trailing zeros after a decimal point go ("4,812.50" is "4812.5", "3.0"
 *   is "3"), but other decimals stay: "4812.05" isn't "4812.5";
 * - currency symbols next to a number go ("£4,812" is "4812");
 * - an accounting negative "(4,812)" reads "-4812";
 * - a number is matched whole: "4812" isn't found in "14812", "48125",
 *   "4812.5" or "-4812".
 *
 * Slides are matched with `numbers: "if-needed"`: as they are first, then,
 * if the quote isn't found, with number formatting normalised. A chart's
 * figures are stored as the values the file caches ("Jun: 1560") but drawn,
 * and so quoted, in its number format ("Jun: 1,560") (#76). A quote found as
 * it is stays found, so a slide's other text is matched as before.
